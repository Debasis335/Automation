Q-1
Has the "Requester Name" been updated to reflect who the ticket is for? (Section 2b)- Here we need to check the Requester column of Current_day_by_Technician excel if data available then we need to fill "No Audit" else "Normal Audit reuired" then update in note column like Requester name missing otherwise no need to put anything in Note column

	
Q-2
Has the ticket "Subject" been updated to leverage the naming convention "SERVICE - Brief Description of Issue or Request"? (Section 5a ix)- 
here we need to take the 'issue description' column from the Current_day_by_Technician excel and create subject header as like below format and need to compare with subject description if 70% matches then 'yes' else 'Manual audit required' 

correct format like one word with capital letter followed by - then subject description
'CLOCK - Adjust and Add EST clock'
'CASEWARE - Unable to access the file'
'CASEWARE - Server licensing issue.'
'PASSWORD - DS1 account'
'SPAM - Email from aol.com'
'PPC - Single audit missing template update'
'QUICKBOOKS - Unable to map R drive'

Incorrect format

'Password - No access to Work'
'Email may be fake'
'CCH Axcess - Not able to update'
'Security - Email with "Remittance" Subject'
'Immediate Action Required: Return of Berdon HP Laptops'

then update KBA is missing otherwise no need to put anything in Note column

(Section 9)-Here we need to check the Resolution column  of Current_day_by_Technician excel data if 'KBA' or 'Auto resolved' or user confirmation found or available then we need to fill "True" else "False"

Q-5	
Are the resolutions notes clearly and fully documented, including the exact steps taken for resolution? (Section 10a)- Here we need to check the Resolution column  of Current_day_by_Technician excel data if the word 'KBA' or 'Solution article' or Auto resolved and user confirmation must needed then we need to fill "No Audit" else "Normal Audit reuired"

Q-6
