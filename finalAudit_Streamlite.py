                    Evaluation Guidelines:

                    1.Auto-Resolved with User Confirmation:
                    If the issue resolved on its own (e.g., the user fixed it themselves or it resolved without intervention) and the user confirmed it, return: Yes

                    2.Existing KBA Followed with User Confirmation:
                    If the technician referred to a Knowledge Base Article (KBA) or followed documented solution steps, and the user confirmed the solution was followed and effective, return: Yes

                    3.New KBA Submission Based on User Feedback:
                    If the technician submitted a new KBA or solution article request and noted that it was based on user feedback, return: New article submitted

                    4.No User Confirmation or Unclear Resolution:
                    If none of the above conditions are met, or if user confirmation is not clearly mentioned, return: Manual audit required

                    Key Phrases to Look For (Examples of User Confirmation):
                    ‚ÄúUser confirmed issue resolved on its own (i.e., auto-resolved)‚Äù
                    ‚ÄúUser confirmed/acknowledged the issue is resolved and working as expected‚Äù
